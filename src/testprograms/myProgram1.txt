Gag program that prints "I LIKE FEET"

++++++++         sets c0 to 8 for a loop counter
[>+++++++++<-].  creates a loop that adds 9 to c1 8 times for a total of 72 (and clears c0 in the process)

c1 will be our dynamic character cell

>>++++          sets c2 to 4 for a loop counter
[>++++++++<-]   creates a loop that adds 8 to c3 4 times for a total of 32 (and clears c2 in the process)
>[<+>-]         moves c3 into c2 and stops pointer at c3

c2 will be our space key

<<+.            returns to c1 and adds 1 making it 73 (I in ascii) and then prints it out

>.              goes to c2 and prints a space

<+++.           goes to c1 and changes it to 76 (L in ascii) and prints it out

---.            changes c1 back to 73 (I in ascii) and prints it out

++.             changes c1 to 75 (K in ascii) and prints it out

------.         changes c1 to 69 (E in ascii) and prints it out

>.              moves to c2 and prints a space

<+.             moves back to c1 and changes it to 70 (F in ascii) and prints it out

-..             changes c1 to 69 (E in ascii) and prints it out twice

+               makes c1 70 and sets us up for the final loop

<++             sets c0 (which is empty) to 2 as a loop counter

[>+++++++<-]    adds 7 to c1 2 times for a total of 14 (and clears c0 in the process)

>.              moves to c1 (which now holds 84 or T in ascii) and prints it out
